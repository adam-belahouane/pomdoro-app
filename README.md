# Pomodoro-app
a simple web app that allows the users to track their work pace using the pomodoro method.\
we want the interface to be user friendly and it to have multiple timer options such as short break to long break that are customisable.
# Technologies we are going to use
Next.js, tailwind css
our aim is to explore new technologies that neither of us have used before.
# Features
a timer that counts down and makes a sound when it reaches 0 it automatically moves onto short break.
a button to select between short break, long break and work time periods.
a settings modal that allows the user to customise their work time (short break, work time and long break) as well as the colour.

# Workflow
